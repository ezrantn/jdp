# Java Design Patterns Implementation

This repository contains Java code examples for various design patterns implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The included design patterns are:

- Singleton Pattern
- Prototype Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Adapter Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Proxy Pattern

Each design pattern is organized into its own folder within the `src/` directory for easy navigation and understanding.

## Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is implemented in the `SingletonPattern` folder.

### Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It is implemented in the `PrototypePattern` folder.

### Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is implemented in the `FactoryPattern` folder.

### Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It is implemented in the `BuilderPattern` folder.

### Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is implemented in the `AbstractFactoryPattern` folder.

### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is implemented in the `Adapter` folder.

### Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern provides a simplified, higher-level interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It is implemented in the `Facade` folder.

### Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is implemented in the `DecoratorPattern` folder.

### Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is implemented in the `ProxyPattern` folder.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code examples in this repository, you need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a code editor of your choice.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/thisdoraemon/design-patterns-oop.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific design pattern folder you want to explore, e.g., `SingletonPattern`.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or code editor.
4. Compile and run the Java files to see the design pattern in action.
